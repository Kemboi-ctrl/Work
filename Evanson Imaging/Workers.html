<p>I am currently a college student studying Physics and Mathematics. I have had a passion for technology since a young age and absolutely love learning and investing. 
    I have started two businesses in the past couple of years, my first was a landscaping company which was incredibly fun. We were able to land a couple of deals with Lowes and ended up completely redoing about 4 of their locations in the local area. 
    My second was a car dealership currently located in Ramsey MN. 
    Day to day we buy and sell all sorts of vehicles and I have learned a great deal about vehicles from working on them every day. It was learning about how far 3D technology has come in the past couple of years and wanting to eventually get into the wonderful world of real estate that I decided to start this!</p>

<p> I am a student currelty attending MCTC. I am currently pursuing
    my computer science degree and also on the job market for Web Developer jobs. 
    I am also doing small projects for people as I progress to be a better coder and learn something 
    new everyday. I've always been a problem solver at heart. Though I love computer science; I also love using my camera.
I've always enjoyed using all types of cameras from Nikon Dslr's to GoPro's. I was excited to join John on this buisness.
I figured it'd be a great way to use my time to not only do something I love,
but to also learn about 3D technology through the process also. </p>
